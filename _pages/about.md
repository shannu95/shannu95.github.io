My name is Shanmukha Agastyaraju and I graduated from Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois, USA in December 2017 with a Master's Degree in Computer Science. During my masters, I gained proficiency in Big Data and Machine Learning algorithms which helped me to do some projects in Natural Language Processing and Genetic Algorithms.
