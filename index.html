        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Shanmukha Agastyaraju and I graduated from Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois, USA in December 2017 with a Master's Degree in Computer Science. During my masters, I gained proficiency in Big Data and Machine Learning algorithms which helped me to do some projects in Natural Language Processing and Genetic Algorithms.</p>
        <p>
            Undergraduate education was the phase when I was introduced to core subjects and principles that gave me a lucid understating of what Computer Science is, fundamentals that will be utilitarian for applying in the real world scenario and forming a base for postgraduate studies. In the initial stages of my undergraduate study, I have come across certain programming languages such as C, C++ during which I came to know that we can develop big console games utilizing these languages. In my third and fourth semesters, I was excited great to learn courses such as Core JAVA, Computer Organization, Database Management Systems, Computer Networks and Operating systems. Exploration in these areas encouraged me to present a paper entitled RAMCLOUD at IIT Hyderabad. RAMCLOUD is a new approach to information storage, where data is kept entirely in Dynamic RAM. Hence, it becomes easier for the user to retrieve data with lower access latency and higher throughput. This experience opened up a new vista as an engineer, that computer science is not just confined to mastering languages, for the purpose of an engineer is to look at the bigger picture and solve future challenges. In this regard I am quite intrigued by Big Data. It is in collating, assimilating, analyzing, representing and surmising truly large amounts of data that I see a big future in. Deciphering people’s actions has today come to be the greatest resource to understanding our world, providing a continuous real-time picture of almost every corner of the planet.  </p>

<p>Later, in order to ameliorate my organizational skills and leadership qualities, I organized an event titled SCIENZA CIFARIO as part of the PROMETHEAN 2015, which was a national level technical symposium at my institution. This event consisted of two rounds. The students who cleared first round were eligible for second round where they were given a C program to find the desired output. Fifth semester was the time when I got the opportunity to grasp basic concepts of web technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript which aided me in comprehending the innate love for online game development and about how social networking websites are managed. My urge to know more about these concepts was satisfied when I got selected as an intern at GreyCampus EduTech Pvt. Ltd. I was given the task of creating an intranet portal for the company’s employees which included File Sharing, Events Management and Private Messaging. All of these modules were successfully achieved with the help of a Drupal distribution named Open Atrium. Drupal is a PHP framework and an open source content management system.
